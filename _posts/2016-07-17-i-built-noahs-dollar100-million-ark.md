  At the theme park Ark Encounter, which opened last week in Williamstown,
  Kentucky, thousands of visitors can step inside a recreation of Noah's
  Ark-built to spec as detailed in the Bible. Inside, exhibits attempt to
  explain how two of each animal might have fit on the boat, while visitors can
  pick up souvenirs at the gift shop or eat at a 700-person restaurant on the
  ship.
